# Aerie Shaders

**Aerie** is a pipeline shader for Canvas that unifies the Vanilla style while adding some useful new features like TAA, bloom, autogenerated normals, and colored handheld lighting.

**Canvas** is a client-side optimization mod similar to Sodium and Optifine. It increases performance by using shaders for game rendering, and allows custom third-party shaders using an entirely different format. Aerie requires Canvas, and as such, it will never work with Optifine or Iris!

## how to use third-party shaders with canvas
1. Be sure you're on 1.19.2 or above. Support is not guaranteed for versions that Canvas doesn't actively support.

2. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and get some cool mods that you like

3. Get Canvas Renderer mod through [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/canvas). You can also find an unofficial 1.19.3 build [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614626265663668276/1079640291906170921/canvas-fabric-mc119-1.0.2515-SNAPSHOT.jar). **Keep in mind that Canvas does not work with Sodium, Iris, OptiFine, or OptiFabric.**

4. Download your preferred pipeline shaderpack. If you're looking for alternatives to Aerie, try out [Lumi Lights](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiLights/releases), [Lomo (not for gameplay)](https://github.com/fewizz/lomo/releases), or [Forget-me-not](https://modrinth.com/shader/forgetmenot).

5. Launch your game, put your pipeline resource pack into your resource packs folder and enable the resource pack.

6. Activate your pipeline in `Options / Video Settings / Canvas / Pipeline Options / Pipelines`
